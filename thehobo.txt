The story of the hobo, the busker, and the thief. As told by Dhrubajit Paul Chowdhury.

Once upon a time there was a guy.
He joined a renowned university in Singapore in hopes of pursuing his dreams.
But he forgot that he was nothing but a hobo. 

So one day, the hobo met a thief who was well versed in all trades.
He took pity on the poor hobo, and became friends with him.
He took it upon himself to discipline poor hobo and turn him into a true man.
But he forgot something important.
You guessed it right.
He forgot that a hobo is forever a hobo and hobos like our hobo can never turn to proper men.
